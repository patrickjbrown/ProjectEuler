# ProjectEuler
A collection of coding solutions to the algorithm / mathematics problems from [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about)

## Build/Run Instructions
This is a command-line application with no special steps needed to build. Simply start the Visual Studio debugger, and follow the instructions in the command prompt.

Though in fairness, the answers themselves aren't particularly interesting. It's the code for the solutions that matters. Please feel free to examine the entries in `\Problems`. Each file contains a description of the task/puzzle along with the code that solves it.

## Skills / Concepts / Technologies
This project showcases the following skills, concepts, and technologies:

* C#
* .NET Framework 9.0
* Algorithm design
